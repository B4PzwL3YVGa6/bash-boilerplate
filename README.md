Bash Boilerplate
================

A collection of example bash scripts that can be used as starting points.

I also use these script to record and document various common approaches and
conventions that I've learning and encountered while working with bash. To this
end, each script contains a lot of comments attempting to describe the
functionality and syntax as much as possible.

In many cases there are debug statements or example code that demonstrate
functionality or reveal the state of the program at a certain point. These
should generally be removed when customizing the scripts, while retaining the
parts that still apply. Especially in the case of the `bash-with-commands`
script, it's probably a good idea to play around with the different features
before diving into customization.

## bash-simple

A simple bash script with some basic strictness checks and help features.

## bash-simple-plus

A simple bash script with some basic strictness checks, option parsing,
help features, easy debug printing.

## bash-with-commands

An example of a bash program with commands. This contains lots of features.
